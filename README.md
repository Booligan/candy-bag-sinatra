Candy Bag

Usage

Welcome to Candy Bag! Every Halloween, children look forward to collecting candy from around the neighborhood. This app will not only help them keep an inventory of their sweets, but they can also compare their bags with other users.

Installation

Simply clone this repository,

Then execute

  bundle install
Then run

$ rake db:migrate
From there, run

If everything is installed correctly you should see an output of a html link in the console. Copy that link and paste into your browser window. From there you are free to play around and make your own list!
